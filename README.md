# rps-multiplayer
A rock-paper-scissors multiplayer web realtime game. (class)

### Instructions

* Create a game that suits this user story:

  * Only two users can play at the same time.

  * Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

  * The game will track each player's wins and losses.

  * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.

  * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

  * Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.

### Additional Practice and Support

* If you find your skills lacking in any of the subjects we taught you, look at your instructor's in class repository. 

  * Find the exercises that you did in class and redo them from scratch. It might seem redundant at first, but this will help edify the material.

  * You can also watch videos of this all of our past lectures--we've saved these to the repo.

*If you have any questions about this project or the material we have covered, please post them in the community channels in slack so that your fellow developers can help you! If you're still having trouble, you can come to office hours for assistance from your instructor and TAs.

  **Good Luck!**
